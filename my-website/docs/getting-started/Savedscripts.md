# Saved Scripts

The **Saved Scripts** section of the Herbie Chrome extension allows users to save, manage, edit, and retrieve scripts and recorded actions. This feature is particularly useful for users who need to reuse or modify existing scripts for automation tests.

## Overview

In the **Saved Scripts** section, users can view a list of all previously saved scripts and recordings. Each script is displayed with the following elements:
- **Title:** A user-defined or default name for the script, which is editable.
- **Timestamp:** The date and time when the script was saved.
- **Script Content:** The detailed list of commands and actions saved in the script.
