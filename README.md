Herbie
======

Herbie is a set of tools for developing BDD (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) scripts for testing.  The premise is that the scripts should be human understandable and author-able.

There are several different components to Herbie:

1. An English like language parser specifically for understanding documentation like directives: Vision.
2. An interactive inspector to make it easier for Vision authors to discover what elements are on a page.
3. A simple Vision interpreter that allow an author to test/debug Vision script. 

The jQuery Simulate Extended plug-in (a.k.a. jquery-simulate-ext) provides methods for simulating complex
user interactions based on the [jQuery.simulate()](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate) plug-in.
The plug-in provides simulation of: Drag & Drop, Key Sequences, Key Combinations

Chrome Extension
----------------
A Goole Chrome extension is maintained here: [Chrome Plugin Source](chrome_extension).  To install:
* First, clone the project to your local machine.
* Chrome -> Preferences... -> Extensions 
* Make sure "Developer mode" is checked (upper left)
* Press "Load unpacked extension..."
* Browse to the chrome_extension folder in the project.
* viola.  Now a Herbie robot button should exist on the toolbar.  It will inject Herbie into the backgound of the current tab of any webpage.
